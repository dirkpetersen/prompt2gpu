# Prompt2GPU

** Repository with auto genernated GPU code (mostly Python, C, CUDA ) **

We use various LLMs to generate code that runs on GPUs. Each folder has
a CLAUDE.md (For Claude Code) and/or a CONVENTIONS.md (for Aider.chat) 
file that contains the instructions (Prompt) for auto-generating the code
